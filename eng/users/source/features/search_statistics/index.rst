Search Statistics
=================

Searches made through the user interface on the local catalog are logged to the GeoNetwork database. The database holds metadata about the search request (eg. date on which it was made, simple or advanced, query, ip address of the client making the request) and the details of the search terms/parameters and values used in the search query.
