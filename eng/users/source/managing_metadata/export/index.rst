Export facilities
=================

GeoNetwork has two different types of export function - both of which operate on selected sets of metadata from the search results. As such they are accessible from the "actions on selection" menu as shown in the following example:

.. figure:: export-selected-as-zip-csv.png

*The export functions: ZIP and CSV - highlighted*

Export as a ZIP archive
```````````````````````

When a selected set of metadata records is exported as a ZIP archive, each metadata record is inserted in the ZIP archive as a directory containing the metadata, any data uploaded with the metadata record and the thumbnails. This type of ZIP archive is the MEF (Metadata Exchange Format) Version 2.0. You can find more details of MEF V2 in the GeoNetwork Developers Manual.

Export as a CSV file
````````````````````

When a selected set of metadata records is exported as a CSV/TXT file, the following process takes place:

- a brief summary of some of the elements from each selected metadata record (stored in the geonet:info element) is generated by GeoNetwork
- the elements common to all geonet:info elements are extracted (as they may differ according to the metadata schema)
- a title record with comma separated element names is created
- the content of each element is laid out in comma separated forms. Where there is more than one geonet:info field (eg. for geoBox), the content is separated using '###'.

An example of an ISO metadata record in CSV format is shown as follows:

::

 "schema","uuid","id","title","geoBox","metadatacreationdate"
